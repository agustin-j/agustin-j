## ABOUT ME
<p align="justify">I'm Agustín and this is my <i>personal github</i>. Here you can find different projects and my <i><a href="https://agustin-j.github.io">github-page</a></i>. I'm currently studying <i>mechanical engineering</i> and taking some <i>electronic engineering</i> classes when I can. For me, learning is really enjoyable, specially when it's about topics that go beyond my limits and that are not really related to what I'm studying. That's why some of the projects are just me experimenting with different ideas and trying to incorporate other pieces of knowledge that have nothing to do with the subject matter.</p>
